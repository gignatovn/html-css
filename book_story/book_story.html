	<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
	<p>
		Molly had been starting out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of <em>Nature, New Scientist</em>, and all the other scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of <em>On The Road</em>. It had been Molly's favourite book since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.

		She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under the poster with an Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>.
